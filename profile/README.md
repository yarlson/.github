## Hi there 👋

If any of my tools save you time or spare you from yak-shaving, consider supporting the work behind them:

It helps me keep building and maintaining things that (hopefully) make your setup suck less.

### Featured projects

#### 🔗 Lnk  
Git-native dotfiles management that doesn’t suck.  
https://github.com/yarlson/lnk

Lnk handles the boring parts: safely moving files, creating clean symlinks, managing host-specific configs, recursive directory ops, preview mode, bootstrap scripts — all in one small binary.  
If you’ve ever hand-symlinked dotfiles at 2AM and regretted it, Lnk is for you.

#### 🚀 FTL  
Faster-Than-Light deployments with zero ceremony.  
https://github.com/yarlson/ftl

FTL is a lightweight deployment tool that gives you zero-downtime releases, automatic SSL, health checks, Docker builds, log streaming, and GitHub Actions integration — all from a single YAML file.  
CI/CD without the “CD/CD”.

Built with ❤️ for developers who value simplicity and speed.
